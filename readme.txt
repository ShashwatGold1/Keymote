I want to start the electron application when my computer start  (at the startup) automatically  so it connect automatically to the mobile app.

it's not available in the open Internet. it's just working with my hotspot. I want it to work with the open Internet. 

In the Desktop Devices the keyboard is not needed in the frontend  other all  thing s as it is. 

application is not working when the  hotspot  and internet is turned up after the login

once electron app is closed completely in the computer with the  backend the ui  and restarted again.  but Android app is not close or the wave is not closed   then that time when the app is started again its must ask in the mobile app or the web for pin.  currently instead of asking pin its not working 

if the first  pin is wrong   typed Then it's not working with second  PIN properly or you can say it's not connecting. its  showing connecting but not connecting or taking too much long time in connecting
